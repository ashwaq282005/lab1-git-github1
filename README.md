Lab 1: Git &amp; GitHub for ML Projects
Hi I'm Ashwaq ALqahtani 
I'm a third-year cybersecurity major. I have an interest about learning about digital forensics and solving crimes. I am really looking forward to this course since it will teach me more about machine learning and how it can be used in practice.

I enjoy to read novels and listen to podcasts that cover different topics when I have free time.
